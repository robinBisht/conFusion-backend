## Synopsis
This project is made for Coursera's "Server Side Development with Node, Express and MongoDB" course. This course is taught by Jogesh Muppala, professor at The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.
In this project I have made the REST api for the conFusion angular app, the frontend part of this project.
This Assignment also makes use of Facebook OAuth Authorization. In order to make it work please setup an App by going to https://developers.facebook.com/apps/ and register your app by following the instructions there and obtain your App ID and App Secret. Then Paste the App ID in public/index.html and both the ID and Secret in config.js.
